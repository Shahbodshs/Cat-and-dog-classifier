# Cat and dog classification CNN model using VGG-16

In the branch __Code__ there a code written for implementing(fine-tuning) a model called VGG-16 for cats and dogs classification algorithm. 
The steps for the codes are totally explain inside th notebook, so there is no reason to mention them in here.

## Updates:
The model is doinng pretty much a good job but i want to make it better in the future, so for further updates, i will mention the changes here.
